#Notes

This is a project to mix the simplified rules of Dungeons and Dragons board games with the more complex and rich rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

## Rule Diffs

### Players

The DnD Adventure board games come with pre-defined character cards. This project will use a simplified version of the [5th edition character sheets](http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/5E_CHARACTERSHEETSV3.ZIP). Players have the ability to roll their own character.

#### Form Fields

##### Core Fields

- Name
- Race
- Class
- Alignment
- Experience Points

##### Attributes

Main base attributes for every character.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

##### Derived Attributes

Attributes derived from a combination of the main attributes and level / class.

- Proficiency Bonus
- Inspiration (gained whenever a natural 20 is rolled)
- Passive Wisdom

##### Combat/Physical Attributes

- Armor Class
- Speed
- Current HP
- Maximum HP
- Attacks, Spells, and abilities.
- Equipment

### Turns

These are the phases of a player turn.

- Hero Phase
- Exploration Phase
- Villain Phase
- Cleanup

#### Hero Phase

This is the phase in which a player moves through the dungeon, attacks monsters, and performs actions such as inspecting chests or trading items with other players.

Perform one of the following actions:

- Move and then perform an action (attack, search, trace, etc...)
- Perform an action and then move.
- Make two moves.

When a player has finished the Hero Phase the Exploration Phase begins.

#### Exploration Phase



## Misc

- Instead of Encounters doing one thing there should be a beneficial and a detrimental version of each card. Roll a charisma check to determine if the Encounter does something positive or negative. This makes charisma a useful attribute to the DnD Adventure system.

- Inspiration allows you to re-roll and roll. A player gains 1 inspiration when they roll a natural 20.
