# Notes

This is a project to mix the simplified rules of Dungeons and Dragons board games with the more complex and rich rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

## Rule Diffs

### Players

The DnD Adventure board games come with pre-defined character cards. This project will use a simplified version of the [5th edition character sheets](http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/5E_CHARACTERSHEETSV3.ZIP). Players have the ability to roll their own character.

#### Form Fields

##### Core Fields

- Name
- Race
- Class
- Alignment
- Experience Points

##### Attributes

Main base attributes for every character.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

##### Derived Attributes

Attributes derived from a combination of the main attributes and level / class.

- Proficiency Bonus
- Inspiration (gained whenever a natural 20 is rolled)
- Passive Wisdom

##### Combat/Physical Attributes

- Armor Class
- Speed
- Current HP
- Maximum HP
- Attacks, Spells, and abilities.
- Equipment

### Turns

These are the phases of a player turn.

1. Hero Phase
2. Exploration Phase
3. Villain Phase
4. Cleanup

#### Hero Phase

This is the phase in which a player moves through the dungeon, attacks monsters, and performs actions such as inspecting chests or trading items with other players.

Perform one of the following actions:

- Move and then perform an action (attack, search, trace, etc...)
- Perform an action and then move.
- Make two moves.

When a player has finished the Hero Phase the Exploration Phase begins.

#### Exploration Phase

This is the phase in which you add new Dungeon Tiles, draw Monster Cards and place Monsters.

1. If your Hero occupies and unexplored edge space, go on to Step 2.

If you aren't on an unexplored edge space, you aren't in position to draw and place a new Dungeon Tile. In this case, go on to the Villain phase.

2. Draw a Dungeon Tile and place it with it's triangle pointing to the unexplored edge of the tile you are exploring from.

3. Place a Monster on the new tile.

When you have finished all the steps in your Exploration Phase, your Villain Phase begins.

<aside>
  When you have to "place a monster," this is shorthand for draw a Monster Card of a level that matches your Hero's level and place the corresponding Monster figure on the bone pile that's on the Dungeon Tile you just placed.
</aside>

#### Villain Phase

This is the phase in which you draw and play Encounter Cards, as well as when you activate the Villain (if the Villain is in play) and any Monster and Trap Cards you may have.

1. If you didn't place a Dungeon Tile in your Exploration Phase, or you didn't end your Exploration phase with a Monster on the same tile, or if you placed a Dungeon Tile with a black triangle, draw and play an Encounter Card.

2. If the Villain is in play, activate the Villain. (There may be more than one Villain in play, depending on the adventure. In this case, activate each Villain, one at a time.)

3. Activate each Monster (except newly placed Monsters) and Trap Card, in turn, in the order you drew them. Follow the tactics on the Monster Card to determine what each Monster does on its turn.

4. Your Hero and any newly placed Monster roll initiative!

## Misc

- Instead of Encounters doing one thing there should be a beneficial and a detrimental version of each card. Roll a charisma check to determine if the Encounter does something positive or negative. This makes charisma a useful attribute to the DnD Adventure system.

- Inspiration allows you to re-roll and roll. A player gains 1 inspiration when they roll a natural 20.
