# Notes

This is a project to mix the simplified rules of Dungeons and Dragons board games with the more complex and rich rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

## Rule Diffs

### Players

The DnD Adventure board games come with pre-defined character cards. This project will use a simplified version of the [5th edition character sheets](http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/5E_CHARACTERSHEETSV3.ZIP). Players have the ability to roll their own character.

#### Form Fields

##### Core Fields

- Name
- Race
- Class
- Alignment
- Experience Points

##### Attributes

Main base attributes for every character.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

##### Derived Attributes

Attributes derived from a combination of the main attributes and level / class.

- Proficiency Bonus
- Inspiration (gained whenever a natural 20 is rolled)
- Passive Wisdom

##### Combat/Physical Attributes

- Armor Class
- Speed
- Current HP
- Maximum HP
- Attacks, Spells, and abilities.
- Equipment

### Turns

These are the phases of a player turn.

1. Hero Phase
2. Exploration Phase
3. Villain Phase
4. Cleanup

#### Hero Phase

This is the phase in which a player moves through the dungeon, attacks monsters, and performs actions such as inspecting chests or trading items with other players.

Perform one of the following actions:

- Move and then perform an action (attack, search, trace, etc...)
- Perform an action and then move.
- Make two moves.

When a player has finished the Hero Phase the Exploration Phase begins.

#### Exploration Phase

This is the phase in which you add new Dungeon Tiles, draw Monster Cards and place Monsters.

1. If your Hero occupies and unexplored edge space, go on to Step 2.

If you aren't on an unexplored edge space, you aren't in position to draw and place a new Dungeon Tile. In this case, go on to the Villain phase.

2. Draw a Dungeon Tile and place it with it's triangle pointing to the unexplored edge of the tile you are exploring from.

3. Place a Monster on the new tile.

When you have finished all the steps in your Exploration Phase, your Villain Phase begins.

<aside>
  When you have to "place a monster," this is shorthand for draw a Monster Card of a level that matches your Hero's level and place the corresponding Monster figure on the bone pile that's on the Dungeon Tile you just placed.
</aside>

#### Villain Phase

This is the phase in which you draw and play Encounter Cards, as well as when you activate the Villain (if the Villain is in play) and any Monster and Trap Cards you may have.

1. If you didn't place a Dungeon Tile in your Exploration Phase, or you didn't end your Exploration phase with a Monster on the same tile, or if you placed a Dungeon Tile with a black triangle, draw and play an Encounter Card.

2. If the Villain is in play, activate the Villain. (There may be more than one Villain in play, depending on the adventure. In this case, activate each Villain, one at a time.)

3. Activate each Monster (except newly placed Monsters) and Trap Card, in turn, in the order you drew them. Follow the tactics on the Monster Card to determine what each Monster does on its turn.

4. If your Hero has not yet performed an action this turn and only moved once for newly placed Monster roll initiative! Roll a d20 for the Monster and your Hero and add their Dexterity modifiers to the roll. If the Monster's total is higher it performs it's action that applies to the situation. Otherwise the monster is surprised and does nothing on your turn.

When you are done with your Villain Phase, the player to your left begins his or her turn.

### Movement

During your turn your Hero moves through the dungeon crypt to attack Monsters, explore, and achieve the adventure's objective. Use the following rules for movement.

#### When do you move?

Your Hero usually moves during the Hero Phase of your turn.

The effect of an ability, item, or encounter can make your Hero move at other times as well.

#### How Do You Move?

Your Hero moves according to his or her Speed. Your Speed is the number of squares you can move your Hero during your turn.

Think of your Hero's speed as your movement budget. Each time you move a square, you spend 1 point from that budget. When you have no more speed left, you can't move any more.

Each turn you can spend up to your speed budget to move your hero. Your hero can attack either before or after moving, or move twice instead of making an attack.

- Your hero can move in any direction, including diagonally, as long as you have the necessary speed to spend.
- You can't move your hero into a square filled with a wall.
- You can't move your hero into a square occupied by a monster.
- You can move your hero through a square occupied by another hero, bit you can't end your movement there.

### Attacks

A hero makes attacks using his or her hero's spells, abilities, or items. Most abilities are related to the hero's class, but some heroes also have a racial power (such as dragonborn's Dragon Breath).

## Misc

- Instead of Encounters doing one thing there should be a beneficial and a detrimental version of each card. Roll a charisma check to determine if the Encounter does something positive or negative. This makes charisma a useful attribute to the DnD Adventure system.

- Inspiration allows you to re-roll and roll. A player gains 1 inspiration when they roll a natural 20.
